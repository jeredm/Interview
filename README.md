# Interview
![.NET Core](https://github.com/jeredm/Interview/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg?branch=master)

This project explores data structures and algorithms in C#. They are a work in progress and are not bug free.
Feel free to contribute your ideas and fixes. I am using this as a tool to prepare for interviews.

## Running the Application
- Ensure you have the .NET Core 3.1 SDK installed
- Each project has a separate test project. Use the tests to see working examples.

# Dynamic
Holds a few dynamic programming examples

# StringManipulation
Holds example problems to string and subsets of a string.
Here is a list of the problems:
- Sliding sliding window to find sub string length

# SortOrder
Holds different sorting and searching examples.
Here is a list of the different sort options:
- Bubble sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Binary search

# Tree
Explores the Tree data structure. It focuses on a binary search tree.
This tree has examples of:
- Inserting a node
- Removeing a node
- Finding a node
- Determining tree depth
- Determining the number of nodes in the tree
- In order traversal (DFS)
- Pre order traversal (DFS)
- Post order traversal (DFS)
- Level order traversal (BFS)
- Create a BST with the minimum height

We could add:
- Width of the tree (the maximum number of nodes at one level)
- Diameter of the tree (longest path between two leaves)
